Dateiname und Zeilennummer 

-H, --with-filename
              Print the file name for each match.  This is the default when there is more than one file to search.  This is a GNU extension.

-h, --no-filename
              Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is the default when there is only one file (or only standard input) to search.

-n, --line-number
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.
